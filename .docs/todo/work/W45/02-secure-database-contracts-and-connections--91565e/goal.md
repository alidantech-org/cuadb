# 02 — Secure database contracts and connections — Goal

## Outcome
Provide one small engine-independent interface for database discovery, metadata and row retrieval. Make a PostgreSQL URL the default connection input and define capabilities before expanding to MySQL, SQLite or SQL Server. This group owns lifecycle, timeout and read-only guarantees; it must not leak SQL or vendor-specific catalog assumptions into web templates.

## Definition of done
This group is complete when its implemented behavior is verifiable through the documented checks, not merely when files exist. Functionality must remain read-only and obey the shared database capability contract. All error states need truthful, usable messages and no credential disclosures. Work should be integrated with the existing single-process Rust application and browser shell, without introducing a separate runtime service. The group tasks describe individual deliverables and must be completed through Task checklists rather than a parallel root TODO file.

## Boundaries
Do not implement adjacent groups speculatively. Keep changes modular, add tests that can run without a live database when possible, and document any fixture-only validation explicitly. Preserve the existing Bun root commands and localhost deployment assumptions. Record decisions and unexpected compatibility limits in the Task workspace.
