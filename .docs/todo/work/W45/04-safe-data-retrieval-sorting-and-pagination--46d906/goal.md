# 04 — Safe data retrieval, sorting and pagination — Goal

## Outcome
Implement the core read-only viewing capability with bounded, predictable SQL and correct typed values. A user must be able to open any permitted PostgreSQL table, read a page, sort an allowed column and navigate safely without requesting the entire relation. This group is the performance and query-security center of the project.

## Definition of done
This group is complete when its implemented behavior is verifiable through the documented checks, not merely when files exist. Functionality must remain read-only and obey the shared database capability contract. All error states need truthful, usable messages and no credential disclosures. Work should be integrated with the existing single-process Rust application and browser shell, without introducing a separate runtime service. The group tasks describe individual deliverables and must be completed through Task checklists rather than a parallel root TODO file.

## Boundaries
Do not implement adjacent groups speculatively. Keep changes modular, add tests that can run without a live database when possible, and document any fixture-only validation explicitly. Preserve the existing Bun root commands and localhost deployment assumptions. Record decisions and unexpected compatibility limits in the Task workspace.
