# 09 — MySQL and MariaDB compatibility — Goal

## Outcome
Bring MySQL and MariaDB into CuaDB through a separate adapter while preserving the same read-only navigation and data-grid contract. Reuse common models and browser components, but implement engine-specific discovery, identifier quoting, data decoding and statistics rather than assuming PostgreSQL SQL syntax works everywhere.

## Definition of done
This group is complete when its implemented behavior is verifiable through the documented checks, not merely when files exist. Functionality must remain read-only and obey the shared database capability contract. All error states need truthful, usable messages and no credential disclosures. Work should be integrated with the existing single-process Rust application and browser shell, without introducing a separate runtime service. The group tasks describe individual deliverables and must be completed through Task checklists rather than a parallel root TODO file.

## Boundaries
Do not implement adjacent groups speculatively. Keep changes modular, add tests that can run without a live database when possible, and document any fixture-only validation explicitly. Preserve the existing Bun root commands and localhost deployment assumptions. Record decisions and unexpected compatibility limits in the Task workspace.
